1. Do not implement any code this week!
2. Based on what we know about linked lists, stacks, and queues, design a queue data structure:

    1. What functions are we likely to need for a queue to function like the one discussed in class?

        -An array to store internal stack values
        -a way of pushing onto a stack
        -a way to pop off a stack
        -possibly have a way to peek at the top of the stack
        -isempty

    2. What values will we need to know about the structure for our queue to function properly?

        -Needs to track the front of the queue

3. Based on what we know about linked lists, design a list data structure that allows us to add (insert) or remove (delete) values at a given location in the list (instead of the top of a stack or the front or back of a queue):

    1. What functions are we likely to need for a list to function like this?

        -

    2. What values will we need to know about the structure for our list to function properly?

        -


4. Commit changes to your design into your git repo frequently while designing (in an obvious assignment 2 folder or repo),
(Also remember to double check that I am a collaborator on your project or the git repo is otherwise accessible by the instructor)

5. Submit a link to your git repo to Moodle to remind us to grade it.
